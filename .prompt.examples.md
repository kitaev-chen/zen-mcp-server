## thinkdeep
Use thinkdeep with model cli:kimi to analyze [项目/问题].

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Every step must include model="cli:kimi" parameter
2.  **NEVER** report confidence as 'certain'. The maximum allowed confidence is 'almost_certain'.
3.  Even if you are 100% sure, you MUST set confidence to 'very_high' or 'almost_certain' in the final step.
4.  I explicitly REQUIRE the "Expert Analysis" phase to run. Do not skip it.
5.  File paths must use full absolute paths (e.g., C:\Users\...\server.py)
6.  Set next_step_required=false for the final step
6.  Please reply in Chinese.
